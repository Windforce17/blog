* **REPORT:** Outputs all results to text in the loot directory for later reference. To enable reporting, append 'report' to any sniper mode or command.
* **STEALTH:** Quickly enumerate single targets using mostly non-intrusive scans to avoid WAF/IPS blocking
* **DISCOVER:** Parses all hosts on a subnet/CIDR (ie. 192.168.0.0/16) and initiates a sniper scan against each host. Useful for internal network scans.
* **PORT:** Scans a specific port for vulnerabilities. Reporting is not currently available in this mode.
* **FULLPORTONLY:** Performs a full detailed port scan and saves results to XML.
* **WEB:** Adds full automatic web application scans to the results (port 80/tcp & 443/tcp only). Ideal for web applications but may increase scan time significantly.   
* **WEBPORTHTTP:** Launches a full HTTP web application scan against a specific host and port.
* **WEBPORTHTTPS:** Launches a full HTTPS web application scan against a specific host and port.
* **NOBRUTE:** Launches a full scan against a target host/domain without brute forcing services.
* **AIRSTRIKE:** Quickly enumerates open ports/services on multiple hosts and performs basic fingerprinting. To use, specify the full location of the file which contains all hosts, IP's that need to be scanned and run ./sn1per /full/path/to/targets.txt airstrike to begin scanning.
* **NUKE:** Launch full audit of multiple hosts specified in text file of choice. Usage example: ./sniper /pentest/loot/targets.txt nuke. 
* **LOOT:** Automatically organizes and displays loot folder in your browser and opens Metasploit Pro and Zenmap GUI with all port scan results. To run, type 'sniper loot'.
* **UPDATE:** Checks for updates and upgrades all components used by sniper.
